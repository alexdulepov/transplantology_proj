# Nested Cross-Validation with VSURF and Elastic Net

This repository contains a set of R utilities for running nested cross-validation pipelines that combine VSURF-based variable selection with elastic-net modelling.  Workflows are provided for both binary classification and continuous outcomes, together with helper functions for summarising resampling performance and extracting final coefficient sets.

## Repository Contents

- `Functions_nested_CV(VSURF+elastic_net).R` – core implementation.  Includes:
  - `nested_elastic_binary_outcome()` / `nested_elastic_continuous_outcome()` for repeated nested resampling.
  - `inner_perf_nested_*()` and `outer_perf_nested_*()` helpers that turn resampling objects into tidy performance summaries.
  - `final_model_with_coefs()` to refit a final elastic-net model (after VSURF or self-selection) on the full dataset and return coefficient estimates.
- `demo_usage.R` – minimal synthetic example that sources the core functions and runs the binary workflow end-to-end.
- `proj_transp.R` – end-to-end analysis script for a transplant cytokine dataset (data import, cleaning, imputation, exploratory analysis, and VSURF/elastic-net modelling).
- `requirements.R` – installs and loads the full package stack required by the above scripts.

## Installation

Install the required packages once per R environment:

```r
source("requirements.R")
```

`requirements.R` installs CRAN dependencies (VSURF, caret, glmnet, tidyverse, recipes, ModelMetrics, yardstick, MLeval, CalibrationCurves, dcurves, readxl, statip, pheatmap, janitor, doParallel, devtools, ranger, kknn, foreach, iterators, VIM) and the `prg` package from GitHub before loading everything into the session.

## Usage

### 1. Binary outcome workflow

```r
source("Functions_nested_CV(VSURF+elastic_net).R")

# Data frame 'df' must contain the outcome column plus predictors
# All numeric predictors should be non-negative because log1p preprocessing is applied

results <- nested_elastic_binary_outcome(
  df,
  outcome_var = "outcome",
  positive_class = "Yes",
  negative_class = "No",
  cv_outer_folds = 5,
  cv_outer_repeats = 20,
  inner_cv_method = "repeatedcv",
  inner_cv_folds = 5,
  inner_cv_repeats = 20,
  selection_rule = "best"
)

# Summaries
inner_perf  <- inner_perf_nested_binary(results)
outer_perf  <- outer_perf_nested_binary(results, positive_class = "Yes")
```

`nested_elastic_binary_outcome()` returns nested CV predictions and metadata, including:

- `avg_final_outer_preds_vs` / `avg_final_outer_preds_elas` – averaged outer-fold probabilities from VSURF-preselected and elastic-net-self-selected models alongside `outer_y` labels.
- `avg_inner_biased_preds_vs` / `avg_inner_biased_preds_elas` – averaged inner-loop predictions used for hyper-parameter selection.
- `avg_final_outer_preds_single_elas` – performance for elastic net without prior VSURF selection and the corresponding baseline prevalence model predictions.
- `sel_vars_df` – for each outer resample, the variables chosen by VSURF and elastic net plus the coefficients of the final refit.
- `inner_perf` – fold-level metrics (ROC AUC, PR AUC, AUPRG, LogLoss, Brier score, MCC, calibration slope/intercept, etc.).

The helper `outer_perf_nested_binary()` also prints stability tables showing how frequently each predictor is selected across outer folds and returns a tidy tibble of outer vs. inner performance metrics.

### 2. Continuous outcome workflow

```r
reg_results <- nested_elastic_continuous_outcome(
  df,
  outcome_var = "outcome",
  cv_outer_folds = 5,
  cv_outer_repeats = 20,
  inner_cv_method = "repeatedcv",
  inner_cv_folds = 5,
  inner_cv_repeats = 20,
  selection_rule = "best",
  optim_metric = "RMSE"
)

inner_reg  <- inner_perf_nested_continuous(reg_results)
outer_reg  <- outer_perf_nested_continuous(reg_results)
```

Continuous workflows mirror the binary setup but report RMSE, MAE, R² (traditional and modern), concordance correlation, MAPE/SMAPE, and calibration diagnostics.

### 3. Fit final models on the full dataset

Use `final_model_with_coefs()` when you are ready to refit a model on all available observations after the resampling study:

```r
final_bin <- final_model_with_coefs(
  df,
  outcome_var = "outcome",
  positive_class = "Yes",
  negative_class = "No",
  family = "binomial",
  cv_method = "repeatedcv",
  cv_folds = 5,
  cv_repeats = 20,
  selection_rule = "best"
)

# Access VSURF- and elastic-net-based coefficient sets
final_bin$sel_vars_df$final_coefs
```

Set `family = "gaussian"` to obtain analogous continuous-outcome fits.

### 4. Demo script

`demo_usage.R` generates a toy binary dataset, runs `nested_elastic_binary_outcome()`, and produces summaries/plots illustrating how to interrogate the returned object.  Use it as a quick sanity check that all dependencies are installed.

## Customisation Highlights

- **Variable selection** – toggle VSURF tree counts (`ntree`, `nforests`) and let elastic net perform its own selection by adjusting `alpha_grid`/`lambda_grid`.
- **Inner resampling** – choose between leave-one-out (`inner_cv_method = "LOOCV"`) or repeated K-fold cross-validation.  The `oneSE` selection rule is available for repeated CV but not LOOCV.
- **Optimisation metric** – binary models optimise LogLoss; continuous models can optimise RMSE or MAE via `optim_metric`.
- **Parallelism** – caret controls and VSURF objects are created with `allowParallel = TRUE`; register a parallel backend before fitting to accelerate large jobs.

## Data Preparation Notes

- Numeric predictors must be ≥ 0 to avoid failures in the `log1p` preprocessing step used by the recipes.
- Character predictors are converted to factors internally; ensure categorical values are coded consistently across rows.
- Inspect `proj_transp.R` for a full cleaning pipeline that demonstrates missing-value imputation with `VIM::kNN`, low-variance filtering, correlation checks, and VSURF exploration prior to the nested CV workflow.

## Troubleshooting & Performance Tips

1. Ensure the outcome column contains both class labels specified via `positive_class`/`negative_class` before fitting binary models.
2. Large nested CV runs (many repeats or high-dimensional predictors) can be computationally intensive—reduce outer repeats or shrink the hyper-parameter grid when prototyping.
3. If VSURF fails because of limited variability, adjust or remove near-zero-variance predictors (see `proj_transp.R` for an example workflow).
4. When using the GitHub-hosted `prg` package, confirm that `devtools` is available and that you have internet access during installation.
